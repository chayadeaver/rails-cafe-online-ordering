# README

Welcome to Chaya's Cafe! This is a restaurant website that allows a customer to create an order by adding items to a cart. There are many items to choose from and anyone can view the menu but to create an order, you must be signed in. 

To test this repo:

1. Clone this repo and run rails server.
2. Go to localhost:3000 on your browser and it takes you to the welcome page.
3. The welcome page has a few links. Without a user account, anyone can view the restaurant menu page.
